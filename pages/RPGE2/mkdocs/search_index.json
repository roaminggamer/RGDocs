This redraws the emitter browser.\n\n\nPress \nescape\n to exit without creating a image layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of 'emitter layers' is to let you preview/edit an emitter definition(s) before generating.\n\n\nYou can add multiple emitters to the main pane of the tool in order to see: a. How then look side-by-side, and b. How they interact with each other.\n\n\n~ The Roaming Gamer\n\n\n\n\nPlease choose \nNebulon\n if you are following along.\n\n\nAdding New Emitter\n\n\nTry clicking the \nGreen \n+\n Button\n, the select \nNew Emitter\n button.  \n\n\nThis will create a 'default' emitter immediately, and you should see this:\n\n\n\n\nThe Interface - Part 2 (Editing)\n\n\nIf you have been reading these docs in order and experimenting as I suggest, you should now have somethink like this:\n\n\n\n\nHiding \n Showing Layers\n\n\nThe first thing you will notice is, that it is quite hard to see the emitters.  Let's fix that.\n\n\n\n\nPlease click the little green \neye\n icon on the 'Black \n White Grid Layer' (left side of screen). This will hide the layer. Clicking it again will show the layer.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will have this:\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Dragging\n\n\nIf you look at the main pane (center) you will see two particle emitters, one on top of the other.\n\n\nYou should also see a faint outline of a square.  Click this square and drag it to the left.  These square are handles that let you drag the emitters around the main pane while editing them.  Clicking a handle also selects the emitter for editting and you will notice the right pane updates to reflect this.\n\n\nYou should have something like this now:\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Re-ordering Layers\n\n\nIf you look to the left side of the screen, you will notice there are four 'buttons/bars':\n\n\n\n\nBlack \n White Grid\n - The image layer we added.\n\n\nNebulon\n - The existing emitter we added from our library.\n\n\nEmitter\n - The generic emitter we added.\n\n\nGreen \n+\n Button\n - The 'add' button.\n\n\n\n\nYou can single click any of the buttons (except add) to select that object/layer.  This will be reflected in the right (edit) pane.\n\n\nYou can click any of these buttons (except add) button and drag them to change the layering order.  (Drag nebulon to layer so it is rendered last.  \nLast is list renderes last.\n)\n\n\nYou can also double click the emitter buttons to rename the emitters.  (Try double clicking \nEmitter\n and renaming it to \"Boom\".)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNING\n \nRenaming an emitter changes the name of the definition in your library too.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have something like this now:\n\n\n\n\nContext Sensitive Editing\n\n\nThe right pane of the tool is, as you will have guessed by now, an editor pane for modifying attributes of the selected image/emitter.\n\n\n\n\nWARNING:\n \nBe aware, when you edit a particle you are changing the definition in the library too.\n \n\n\nSo, if you have an emitter you like, and you want to tweak it while keeping the original:\n\n\nClone the original, rename the cloned copy, then edit it.\n\n\n~ The Roaming Gamer\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n I won't go through every option supported by the emitter editor.  You will need to explore this on your own.  \n\n\nFor now, please just:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the 'Nebulon' emitter.\n\n\nClick the \n1\n button if it is not selected.\n\n\nChange \nEmitter Type\n to \nGravity\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow you should have this:\n\n\n\n\nThe Interface - Part 3 (Generating)\n\n\nThis tool allows you to generate emitter definitions files that are suitable for creating emitter objects with the Corona SDK \nnewEmitter()\n function.\n\n\nIt also lets you generate test projects that are ready to run with SSK2.\n\n\nTo generate either one, simply click, the little 'arrow in a circle' icon on a \nemitter\n button (in left pane).\n\n\nThis will pop up a dialog like this:\n\n\n\n\nHere you can choose a name for the generated emitter file and/or project.  Then click \nEmitter\n to generate an emitter file with its image, or click \nProject\n to generate the emitter and a test project to run it in (requires SSK2 to run).\n\n\nNow, you can fine the generated content by clicking: \nExplore\n \n \nOutput\n.  This will open the folder where you out emitters/projects are generated.\n\n\nMore Docs To Come\n\n\n\n\nThat is all for now.  I will update these docs some more later, but this should be enought to get you started.  If you need help or run into problems, just follow the \nGetting Help\n instructions below.\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\nI will list issues I know about here:\n\n\n\n\nCan't select alternate particle\n - Sorry.  This was an oversight on my part.  The tool comes with a ton of particles to use, but you can ONLY create new emitters with the default particle.  I will fix this in future updates.  Till then, just make your emitters with the default particle and substitute your own image when you use it.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help\n\n\nI will be providing help (exclusively) through the \nCorona SDK Forums\n.
